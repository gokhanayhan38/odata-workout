/**
 * Olingo Server API
 * <p>The OData Library is a protocol implementation of the OData V4.0 standard.
 * For details of this standard see <a href="http://odata.org">odata.org</a>.</p>
 * <p>This API is intended to help implementing an OData service.
 * An OData service consists of a metadata provider implementation and an
 * OData processor implementation.</p>
 * <p>An OData service can be exposed by a web application using the standard java servlet API.
 * For further information, see the <a href="http://olingo.apache.org/doc/odata4/">Olingo
 * tutorials</a> on how to implement an OData service.</p>
 * <p>The main entry point is the org.apache.olingo.server.api.OData class.
 * Use the newInstance() method to create a new object and
 * start providing your service from there.</p>
