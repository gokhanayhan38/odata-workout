/**
 * Olingo Processors
 * <p>Processors are used to handle OData requests and send back the OData reponse.
 * Before a specific processor is called the Olingo library will parse the URI and validate it.
 * Afterwards the Processor which matches the return type is called.
 * Example: If a primitive property is requested by the URI we will call the
 * PrimitiveProcessor.readPrimitive method.</p>
 * <p>Processors can be registered at the {@link org.apache.olingo.server.api.ODataHttpHandler} object.
 * Per default the {@link org.apache.olingo.server.api.processor.DefaultProcessor} is registered
 * to perform basic functionality like delivering the metadata and service documents, respectively,
 * as well as rendering an OData error.
 * In case an application would like to perform custom tasks for these cases a new
 * {@link org.apache.olingo.server.api.processor.ServiceDocumentProcessor} can be registered
 * in order to overwrite the default behavior.
